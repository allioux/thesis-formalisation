# Formalisation

This repository contains the formalisation of (most of) the results presented in my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/allioux/thesis-public).
There are two developments: the first one concerns the type-theoretical definition of opetopes (Chapter 1), while the second one concerns opetopic types and their applications (Chapters 2 and 3). 
Each project comes with the agda source code and a html version thereof. 
They depend on the agda [HoTT library](https://github.com/AntoineAllioux/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible).

These two projects are based on Eric Finster's work:

  - https://github.com/ericfinster/opetopic-types
